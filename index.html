                <h2>Founder Of Pakistan</h2>
                <p><b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah, widely known as Quaid-e-Azam,</b> was the founder of Pakistan and one of the most influential leaders in South Asian history. Born on 25th December 1876 in Karachi, he studied law in England and became a successful barrister. Initially involved with the Indian National Congress, Jinnah later joined the All India Muslim League and became a strong advocate for the rights of Muslims in British India. He believed that Hindus and Muslims were two distinct nations and could not live peacefully under one government. This vision laid the foundation of the Two Nation Theory, which ultimately led to the creation of Pakistan on 14th August 1947. Jinnah became Pakistan's first Governor-General and dedicated the final years of his life to shaping the newly born nation. He passed away on 11th September 1948, but his legacy as the Father of the Nation continues to inspire millions across Pakistan.</p>
